                    <p>Vienna is famed for its coffee-house culture, world-renowned museums, and imperial palaces. According to Mercer, the city also has world-class standards when it comes to areas such as recreation and availability of consumer goods.</p>
                    <p>Vienna also does a good job of blending commercial development and history; it’s first district seamlessly weaves together buildings from the Habsburg empirical era, with modern shopping centres and office blocks.</p>
                    <p>Almost every restaurant in Vienna has schnitzel on the menu, but Figlmüller serves one of the best wiener schnitzels in Vienna.  It is HUGE and easily serves two people.  There are several Figlmüller restaurants in the city, and they are often packed with tourists and locals.  It is worth the wait.  Traditionally a specialist in coffee, I also have to mention Café Central, because I loved the wiener schnitzel here.</p>
