                            <p>Vienna is famed for its coffee-house culture, world-renowned museums, and imperial palaces. According to Mercer, the city also has world-class standards when it comes to areas such as recreation and availability of consumer goods.</p>
                              <p>Vienna also does a good job of blending commercial development and history; it’s first district seamlessly weaves together buildings from the Habsburg empirical era, with modern shopping centres and office blocks.</p>

                              <p>Almost every restaurant in Vienna has schnitzel on the menu, but Figlmüller serves one of the best wiener schnitzels in Vienna.  It is HUGE and easily serves two people.  There are several Figlmüller restaurants in the city, and they are often packed with tourists and locals.  It is worth the wait.  Traditionally a specialist in coffee, I also have to mention Café Central, because I loved the wiener schnitzel here.</p>

                                        <p>Deemed to be the world’s oldest zoo, Schönbrunn Zoo is one of the best places to go with the family. It’s packed with fascinating species and some of the animal kingdom’s top predators so it promises to be an education at the very least. Take your kids around Polar World, Rainforest House and along the Nature Trail to get them in touch with these furry creatures. If you call in advance you can try and schedule your visit to coincide with some shows and feeds to make it even more interactive.</p>
                                          
                                        <li>Children’s Museum</li>
                                        <p>The Children’s Museum in Schönbrunn is another great museum to take the kids to – and it’s what it says on the tin. This museum takes a look back in time at Empress Maria Theresia and her sixteen (!) children who lived in Schönbrunn 300 years ago. Thanks to the size, Schönbrunn could cope with such a brood and kids today can walk through the corridors and rooms once inhabited by the mini Habsburgs and imagine life as an Imperial prince or princess! You can even learn about the popular games they would have played to keep themselves entertained too.</p>

                                        <p>Prater Amusement Park is Vienna’s only fun fair and is open March – October, to entertain the masses! It’s a great place for both kids and adults and you can spend a whole day on the rides, enjoying a picnic and walking around the green park. With over 250 attractions to try – with the most iconic being Vienna Giant Ferris Wheel – it’s also home to Madame Tussauds, a Bunjee Jump and the world’s largest chair-o-plane at 117ms tall. Not one to go on if you have vertigo!</p>

                                        <p>The Vienna Giant Ferris Wheel is one of the most recognisable landmarks on Vienna’s horizon. Dating back to 1896, it was in fact built by a British engineer, Walter Basset, who built similar wheels all around the world from London to Chicago and Paris. The Wheel of History will give you an insight into Vienna’s past and you can learn about the key milestones over the centuries. At nearly 65m high you can enjoy stunning panoramas around Vienna as you enjoy a round-trip on the iconic monument.</p>

                                         <p>Who doesn’t love an open top bus tour? It’s almost like an unspoken rule when you’re on holiday. It’s fun, it’s easy and it’s a great way to see all the site without having to cover all the miles – a blessing with young kids! With five different lines to choose from, between the iconic Vienna route, to the imperial and historical route; there’s something for everyone. What’s more is there’s a running commentary so you can learn fun facts about the city and hop off if you want to go for an explore.</p>
